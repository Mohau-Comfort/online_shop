## This is my E-Commerce fullstack web app integrated with Stripe payment.

Note: This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# The web app is made using Next js and Sanity IO handling the backend as the API. It is an online store that allows users to buy products available for them. The products can easily be deleted from the Sanity IO backend page which is also hosted, you can edit information about the product as well, price, name etc. The API also allows me to upload the pictures of the product and they well be displayed onto the website as well without any 3rd parties.
